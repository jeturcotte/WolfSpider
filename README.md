# WolfSpider
Named after a line of spiders that hunt rather than build webs, this program aims to scour the internet looking at commentary, trying to assess the tone of conversation based on ideology and host

## Modus Operandi
In theory, this spider is meant to traverse social media, identify-and-anonymize publications (and probably individual articles) and then identify-and-anonymize individual commenters/commenters.  It will, at the very least, collect these data for later analysis (offline), or do some brief anaylsis itself, wherein the language and topic of the article are assessed based either on pre-acknowledged ideology of the publication, and/or assisted machine learning from humans who will identify that publications ideology.  Then it will examine word-use within comments on that publication again, perhaps, with human assited machine learning to isolate examples of constructive argument versus trolling versus hate speech.  Pattern analysis then should help us map out ideologies, word use among its members and detractors, et cetera, for a broader understanding of public opinion on varying polarized topics.
